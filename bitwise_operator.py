#bitwise operator in python

#complement operator(~(tilde))
#x = int(input("enter the  number:"))
#print(~x)
#the output is -13 because we have to take the 2's complement of 12 (:
#13= 00001101
#1's complement is 11110010+1
#11110011
#hence it is -13

#the bitwise operator compares according to the logical operator of there bits
#for example

#for a logical and operator(& is used:)
#for a logical or operator(|is used:)
#for a logical xor oparator(^ is used:)
#for example
a = 12
#12 = 00001100
#13 = 00001101
#according to the and logical operator
# 1-0 = 0

b = 13
print(a & b)
